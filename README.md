# RGB Color Generator

A Simple Yet Powerful Tool Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Proud to share this minimal and interactive RGB Color Generator that I developed using core front-end technologies ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript to handle dynamic updates and UI interaction.
This tool allows users to generate custom colors by adjusting the Red, Green, and Blue sliders in real-time. As the values change, the display updates instantly, showing the newly created color with its corresponding RGB value ‚Äî which can be easily copied with a single click.

The user interface is styled with clean CSS for a modern and responsive look, featuring: 
 ‚úîÔ∏è Smooth slider interactions
 ‚úîÔ∏è Live color preview box
 ‚úîÔ∏è Real-time RGB value display and copy function
 ‚úîÔ∏è A compact, mobile-friendly card layout with subtle shadows

This project was a great way to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, while also focusing on UI/UX consistency.
